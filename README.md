# **CSE-6040 Extra Credit: Can We Predict NBA Playoff Teams from Regular Season Statistics?**

In this project, we aim to explore whether a team's regular-season performance statistics can accurately predict playoff qualification. Using historical data from NBA seasons between 2000 and 2023, we'll cover:

- Which stats are most associated with playoff success?  
- Can we build a model that predicts whether a team will make the playoffs?

This project is built using several concepts covered in classâ€”particularly general Python data cleaning with pandas, correlation analysis, and logistic regression (both manually and using existing libraries).
